Pin definitions of the CDH engineering model board.

The variables defined in this file should be used when working with the corresponding pins
instead of the previous approach of importing the CircuitPython defined 'board' and
'microcontroller' module(s). This ensures any future changes to the board can be
easily integrated into the existing codebase.
