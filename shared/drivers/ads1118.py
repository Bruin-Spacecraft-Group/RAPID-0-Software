        Asynchronous coroutine to sample the ADC on with a given set of settings.

        First, a single-shot conversion command is sent to the ADC with the settings specified.
        Then, the coroutine yields for other tasks for a fixed amount of time based on the
        selected sampling rate to allow the ADC to process the data. Finally, the ADC is polled
        for data readiness and, once readiness is confirmed, the data is read from the ADC.

        the driver will begin the process of resetting the ADC. This process takes 28ms, so in
        the unlikely case that this process needs to occur, overall performance may be degraded.
